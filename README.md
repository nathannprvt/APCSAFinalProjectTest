# APCSAFinalProjectTest
This is a simulation game of a space explorer fighting aliens on the moon.
To run this put the code into a program and then find the button to run it and click it. From there you can follow the instructions from the console to play the game.
The program includes a class for aliens and UFOs and also classes for the loot you may obtain from killing an enemy. It also shows the type of enemy you face using 2d arrays.
The program says that you win the simulation after a bunch of levels but not quite completing every level. Also if you input a non integer value where one should be it might bug out.
